Write a class named NobelData that reads a JSON file containing data on Nobel Prizes and allows the user to search that data. Specifically, 
your class should have an init method that reads the file, and it should have a method named search_nobel that takes as parameters a year and a category, 
and returns a sorted list of the surnames for the winner(s) in that category for that year (up to three people can share the prize). The year will be a string (e.g. "1975"), 
not a number. The categories are: "chemistry", "economics", "literature", "peace", "physics", and "medicine". The JSON file will be named nobels.json and 
will be provided - you do not need to submit it.
